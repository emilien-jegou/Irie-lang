-- Type judgements: checking and inferring
-- see https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/boxy-icfp.pdf

-- The goal is to check and/or infer the types of all top level bindings
-- (and the types (kinds) of the types.. etc)
--   * evaluate (static) dependent types
--   * type-check
--   * inference: reduce every type to an llvm.AST.Type

-- Rules
-- Var: lets us increase the polymorphism of a term based on env info
-- App: (t a) has the type of the rightmost arrow (t and a's types must be known)
-- ABS1: a lambda abstraction has type (inputType -> returnType)
-- ABS2: make one box around the -> and try again (via ABS1)
-- Let-I : if let x=u in t, we have t has the same type as u
-- Let-S: same but with a user supplied type annotation for the binding
-- GEN : add some free type variables to a type judgment
--   (if they are neither in the environment nor inside boxes in the skolemized type)

-- 1. Inference can guess monotypes, but should not guess polytypes
-- 2. Use locally known information at a function call to instantiate a
-- polymorphic function !

-- we may need to make fresh unification variables during specialisation
-- (at call sites)

-- presumably let-bindings / type functions
-- skolemization = remove existential quantifiers
