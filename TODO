# Compiler coding style
  * Use semialign; in particular careful with zipwith / zip since lists can be diff lengths
## Top
  * language server
  * precompiled modules ('binary' haskell package)
  * Linker; invoke clang
## Parse
  * Use [n..] numbered args from Parser in a safer way
## Types
  * check let | rec
  * don't allow field name collisions in tycon
  * fn Apps are Poison iff the function ret type depends on the poison arg
  * Dependent normalisation & Staging
## Codegen
  * opportunistic instrs that read Terms also need a dumber version for Operands
  * do asmIdx resolution here
  * figure out how ffi handles passing [n x %i1] by value
  * record cons: if term is trivial, write it unconditionally
