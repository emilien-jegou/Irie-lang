# expr2Core
  * separate tyHNames from hNames
  * typeclass "trivial/class"
  * subtyping - algData are also sum polytypes (of their subtypes)
  * modules
  * dont squash bindings
  * tyFunctions

  * tuples (anon product types)
  * redesign toCore for localDecls (~ local modules ?)
  * GuardedRhs
  * more patterns
  * records
  * Case -> Case optimizations
  * precedence (parser doesn't have all infix decls)

# core2Stg
  * tyFunctions (?) - we could reuse functions/structs for polymorphic data

# typeJudge
  * dependent types

# parser
  * linefolds
  * GADT style
  * pattern-match on (->)
  * let-rec (?)
  * source locations

# Prelude / dependent types
  * fold-build
  * fusion across functions ? composition fusion
  * var-arity
  * effects

# LFVM
  * track non-copyable data lifetime
    * data passed to multiple functions:
      if only one wants to modify it: give it ownership and execute last
    * sudoku example - inplace modifcations, that undo as stack unravels

# General
  * error message clarity
